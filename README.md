## 🎯 Objective

To identify and visualize the key factors influencing customer churn, enabling business teams to understand retention challenges and prioritize high-risk segments.  
The dashboard delivers KPI insights, customer segmentation, and churn driver analysis.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Customers with **only 1 product** have the **highest churn rate**.  
- **Inactive customers** churn almost **twice as much** as active ones.  
- The **35–44 age group** shows the highest churn among all age brackets.  
- Lower **credit score ranges** (400–499, 500–599) correspond to higher churn.  
- Geography impacts churn distribution, with some countries showing heavier attrition.  
- Balance distribution patterns differ significantly between churned and retained customers.  
- Risk bucket heatmap highlights segments with stronger churn tendencies.
